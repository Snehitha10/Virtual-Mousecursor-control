# Virtual-Mousecursor-control
Virtual Mouse Cursor Control utilizing head movements and facial expressions to assist the individuals with limited limb mobility.

It is a Human Computer Interaction application- allows you to control your mouse cursor with your head movements and works with just your regular webcam.

This project is deeply centered around predicting the facial landmarks of a given face.  We can accomplish a lot of things using these landmarks from detecting eye-blinks in a video to predicting emotions of the subject.

## Python libraries used:
1. opencv
2. dlib
3. pyautogui
4. imutils

### opencv 
   to continuously capture frames from the webcam.
### dlib 
  offers face detection and recognition
  Provides pretrained model for
  1. face detection that can locate faces in images and videos
  2. facial landmark predictor to predict 68 2D landmarks accurately
### imutils
face_utils module in imutils library typically provides utility functionsfor working with facial landmarks and related tasks in computer vision projects.
### pyautogui
   to programmatically control the mouse and keyboard and it automates the tasks that involves interacting with GUI of your computer. Using this library, one can perform
   1. mouse control
   2. keyboard control
   3. screen capture and unage recognition
   4. GUI interaction
